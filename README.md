# Overview of Analysis
The goal of this analysis is to create a statistical analysis of the temperatures on the city of Oahu during the months of June and December. This is to help determine whether opening up a surf and ice cream shop is a sustainable business all year-round. By creating a query that captures the temperatures specifically for the months of June and December, data can be retrieved for information such as the average, maximum, and minimum temperatures to see if the idea is feasable.

## Results
### June Temperature Analysis
Based on the analysis, it can be seen that there are 1,700 observations for the months of June. These are years that span between 2010 and 2017. The low standard deviation in the readings means a relatively small spread across the temperature observations. This shows that Oahu weather does not seem to fluctuate significantly. The average, minimum, and maximum temperatures are listed below

### December Temperature Analysis
December seems to only have 1,517 observation. This indicates that some of temperature readings cannot be found on certain dates. However, this is already a large dataset, therefore our analysis will still represent most of the infomation needed. From readings below, it can be seen that June and December are close in average, maximum, and minimum temperature. More importantly, the spread is about the same as the spread for the month of June.

## Summary:
By comparing the statistic summary of the two months, it can be said that the temperature patterns remain almost constant throughout the whole year. 
To get a clearer understanding on the general weather patterns in Oahu and a more deatiled analysis, there are two more queries that are needed.

* Although temperatures may be about the same throughout the year, precipitation may not and may also have a significant impact on how the business will survive. Doing a statistically summary of the precipitation patterns for the the months of June and December will give a better understanding of the overall weather pattern for the most part of the year.

* Another query that can be created is one that compares the most active stations that record the weather patterns. This can help us narrow down the best location by giving us the most popular station with the most stable weather patterns.
